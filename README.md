[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andig/evcc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andig/evcc)

EVCC is an EV Charge Controller implemented in [Go](2). It comes with a bundled implementation for Wallbe chargers but supports any type of charger or meter through scripting and integration with MQTT.

**NOTE:** You are using this software **entirely** at your own risk. It is your responsibility to verify it is working as intended.

## Background

EVCC is heavily inspired by [OpenWB](1). However, I found OpenWB's architecture slightly intimidating with everything basically global state and heavily relying on shell scripting. On the other side, especially the scripting aspect is one that contributes to [OpenWB's](1) flexibility.

Hence, for a simplified and stricter implementation of an EV charge controller, the design goals for EVCC were:

- typed language with ability for systematic testing - achieved by using [Go](2)
- structured cnofiguration - supports YAML-based [config file](evcc.dist.yaml)
- avoidance of feature bloat, simple and clean UI - utilizes [Bootstrap](3)
- integration with home automation - supports shell scripts and MQTT
- containerized operation beyond Raspbery Pi - provide multi-arch [Docker Image](4)
- support for multiple load points - tbd

## User interface

EVCC features a clean, non-bloat user interface:

## Installation

### Hardware

Make sure supported charger and meters are professionally installed.

**NOTE**: for Wallbe chargers ensure that the device is configured to allow controlling of charge cycle via ModBus. In order to do that ensure that DIP 10 = ON.

### Software

To build EVCC from source, [Go](2) 1.13 is required:

    make

The preferred way of running EVCC is using the docker image:

    docker pull andig/evcc-bundle:latest

To see the available options:

    docker run andig/evcc-bundle -h

To run EVCC with given config file and UI on port 7070:

    docker run -v $(pwd)/evcc.dist.yaml:/etc/evcc.yaml -p 7070:7070 andig/evcc-bundle

## Configuration

### Charge Modes

Three operation modes are supported:

- **Off**: disable the charger, even if car gets connected.
- **Now** (**Sofortladen**): charge immediately with maximum allowed current.
- **Min + PV**: charge immediately with minimum configured current. Additionally use PV if available.
- **PV**: use PV as available. May not charge the car if PV remains dark.

In general, due to the minimum value of 5% for signalling the EV duty cycle, the charger cannot limit the current to below 6A. If the available power calculation demands a limit less than 6A, handling depends on the charge mode. In **PV** mode,

### PV generator configuration

For both PV modes, EVCC needs to assess how much residual PV power is available at the grid connection point and how much power the charger actually uses. Various methods are implemented to obtain this information, with different degrees of accuracy.

#### PV meter

Configuring a *PV meter* is the simplest option. *PV meter* measures the PV generation. The charger is allowed to consume:

    Charge Power = PV Meter Power - Residual Power

The *Residual Power* is a configurable assumption how much power remaining facilities beside the charger use.

#### Grid meter

Configuring a *grid meter* is the preferred option. The *grid meter* is expected to be a two-way meter (import+export) and return the current amount of grid export as negative value. The charger is then allowed to consume:

    Δ Charge Power = Grid Meter Power - Residual Power

rounded down and capped at zero and

    Charge Power = Current Charge Power + Δ Charge Power

In this setup, *residual power* is used margin to account for fluctuations in PV production that may be faster than EVCC's control loop.

### Charger configuration

When using a *grid meter* for accurate control of PV utilization, EVCC needs to be able to determine the current charge power. There are two configurations for determining the *current charge power*:

#### Charge meter

A *charge meter* is often integrated into the charger but can also be installed separately. EVCC expects the *charge meter* to supply *charge power* and preferably also *total energy*.
If *total energy* is supplied, it can be used to calculate the *charged energy* for the current charging cycle.

#### No charge meter

If not charge meter is installed, *charge power* is deducted from *charge current* as controlled by the charger. This method is less accurate than using a *charge meter* since the EV may chose to use less power than EVCC has allowed for consumption.
If the charger supplies *total energy* for the charging cycle this value is preferred over the *charge meter*'s value (if present)

## Implementation

EVCC consists of four basic elements: *Charger*, *Meter*, *SoC* and *Loadpoint*. Their APIs are decribed in [api/api.go](https://github.com/andig/evcc/blob/master/api/api.go)

### Charger

Charger is reponsible for EV state handling:

- `Status()`: charge controller status (`A...F`)
- `Enabled()`: charger availablity
- `Enable()`: set charger availability
- `ActualCurrent()`: current in A
- `MaxCurrent()`: maximum charge current in A (`ChargeController` only)

Available charger implementations are:

- `wallbe`: implements the interface to the Wallbe Eco chargers
- `configurable`: default charger implementation using configurable plugins for accessing device data

### Meter

Meters provide data about power and energy consumption:

- `CurrentPower()`: power in W
- `TotalEnergy()`: energy in Wh (`MeterEnergy` only)

Meter has a single implementaton where meter readings- power and energy- can be configured to be delivered by plugin.

### SoC

SoC represents a specific EV battery. Configuring a SoC allows to define it's `Capacity (kWh)` and dynamically provide:

- `ChargeState()`: state of charge in %

If SoC is configured and assigned to the charger, charge status and remaining charge duration become available in the user interface.

### Loadpoint

Loadpoint controls the Charger behaviour according to the operations mode- off, now, pv + minimum or pv only.

## Plugins

Plugins are used to implement accessing and updating generic data sources. EVCC supports the following *read/write* plugins:

- `mqtt`: this plugin allows to read values from MQTT topics. This is particularly useful for meters, e.g. when meter data is already available on MQTT. See [MBMD](5) for an example how to get Modbus meter data into MQTT.
This plugin type is read-only and does not provide write access.
- `exec`: the exec plugin executes external scripts to read or update data. This plugin is useful to implement any type of external functionality.

When using plugins for *write* access, the actual data is provided as variable in form of `${var[:format]}`. The variable is replaced with the actual data before the plugin is executed.
